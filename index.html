        <p class="intro">
          As of April of 2020, almost 4.57 billion people were active internet
          users worldwide. It is estimated that 1 billion people have some form
          of disability, many of which are also internet users. Based on these
          facts, it is our responsability as web developers to provide an
          accessible experience to as many individuals as we can.

        <h2>Semantic tags</h2>
        <p>
          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
          documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. The HTML
          structure of a website is made up of tags. For example, the text you
          are reading right now is enclosed in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag,
          which stands for paragraph.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many other HTML tags, such as
          <code>divs</code>, <code>buttons</code>, and <code>forms</code>.
          HTML5, the latest version of HTML, introduced several more "semantic
          elements", including <code>article</code>, <code>aside</code>,
          <code>section</code>, and more. These new elements are meant to
          clearly describe its meaning. This not only helps developers make
          sense of the HTML structure, but it also helps screen reader users
          navigate the page more effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you inspect the source code of this web page, you'll see that some
          of the semantic elements used are
          <code>header</code>, <code>nav</code>, <code>main</code> and
          <code>footer</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Alt text</h2>
        <p>
          Alt text (alternative text) is a word or phrase that can be inserted
          as an attribute in an HTML document to tell Web site viewers the
          nature or contents of an image. Including alt text for images is
          particularly important for screen reader users, who need a written
          description to avoid missing out on the graphic content.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to being an absolutely necessity for accessibility, alt
          text will also help regular users of your site. If an image fails to
          load, its alt text will be displayed instead.
        </p>

        <h3>Example</h3>

        <p class="example">Image loaded successfully &darr;</p>
        <img
          src="https://placekitten.com/800/400"
          alt="Kitten."
          class="kitten"
        />

        <p class="example">Image failed to load &darr;</p>
        <img src="" alt="Kitten." />
