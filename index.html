          As of April of 2020, almost 4.57 billion people were active internet
          users worldwide. It is estimated that 1 billion people have some form
          of disability, many of which are also internet users. Based on these
          facts, it is our responsability as web developers to provide an
          accessible experience to as many individuals as we can.

        <h2>Semantic tags</h2>
        <p>
          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
          documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. The HTML
          structure of a website is made up of tags. For example, the text you
          are reading right now is enclosed in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag,
          which stands for paragraph.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many other HTML tags, such as
          <code>divs</code>, <code>buttons</code>, and <code>forms</code>.
          HTML5, the latest version of HTML, introduced several additional
          "semantic elements", including <code>article</code>,
          <code>aside</code>, <code>section</code>, and more. These new elements
          are meant to clearly describe its meaning. This not only helps
          developers make sense of the HTML structure, but it also helps screen
          reader users navigate the page more effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you inspect the source code of this web page, you'll see that some
          of the semantic elements used are
          <code>header</code>, <code>nav</code>, <code>main</code> and
          <code>footer</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <div class="example-container">
          <div>
            <p class="example">Non-semantic HTML structure</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;div &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p class="example">Semantic HTML structure</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;nav &lt;/nav&gt; 
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;main&gt;
    &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt; 
    &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt; 
&lt;/main&gt;
&lt;footer&gt; &lt;/footer&gt;</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="section-2">
        <h2>Alt text</h2>
        <p>
          Alt text (alternative text) is a word or phrase that can be inserted
          as an attribute in an HTML document to tell Web site viewers the
          nature or contents of an image. Including alt text for images is
          particularly important for screen reader users, who need a written
          description to avoid missing out on the graphic content.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to being an absolutely necessity for accessibility, alt
          text acts as a fallback. If an image fails to load, alt text will
          guarantee that some text will be displayed instead.
        </p>

        <h3>Example</h3>

        <p class="example">Image loaded successfully &darr;</p>
        <img
          src="https://placekitten.com/800/400"
          alt="Kitten."
          class="kitten"
        />

        <p class="example">Image failed to load &darr;</p>
        <img src="" alt="Kitten." />
      </section>
      <section id="section-3">
        <h2>:focus</h2>
        <p>
          Some HTML elements have a hover state to indicate to the users that
          the element is interactive. This is very commonly seen in elements
          such as <code>anchors</code>, which are used for links. Adding hover
          states to your site is generally considered a good practice, but
          there's a problem: it only works if you're using a mouse. Many users,
          including those with dexterity issues and other disabilities,
          exclusively navigate the web using their keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          To solve the accessibility problem of hover states, we have the
          <code>:focus</code> pseudo-class. This CSS pseudo-class represents an
          element (such as a form input or an anchor) that has received focus.
          Including it along with the <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class will make
          sure to cover users who navigate with a mouse, as well as users that
          navigate with a keyboard.
        </p>

        <h3>Example</h3>

        <p>
          Try using the "tab" key to select the URL below and observe if their
          hover effects are triggered.
        </p>

        <p class="example">Without :focus &darr;</p>
        <p><a href="#" class="no-focus">https://www.google.com/</a></p>

        <p class="example">With :focus &darr;</p>
        <p><a href="#" class="focus">https://www.google.com/</a></p>

        <h2>Color contrast ratio</h2>
        <p>
          It goes without saying that it is important that the text on our sites
          is easy to read. To achieve this, we need to make sure that the color
          contrast ratio (the relationship between text color and background
          color) is enough. But, what is "enough"? The Web Content Accessibility
          Guidelines (WCAG) requires text to have a minimum acceptable color
          contrast ratio of 3:1.
        </p>

        <p>
          Adhering to proper color contrast ratios will help everyone, but
          especially users with visibility problems.
        </p>

        <h3>Example</h3>

        <p>
          Keep in mind that a ratio of 1:1 is white text on a white background
          (not visible), and 21:1 is black text on a white background (extremely
          visible).
        </p>

        <h4 class="example">Poor color contrast ratio (1.7:1) &darr;</h4>
        <p class="poor-contrast">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>

        <h4 class="example">Good color contrast ratio (8.3:1) &darr;</h4>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="section-5">
        <h2>Form and aria labels</h2>
        <p>
          Forms on the internet are ubiquitous. Almost every website that
          requires users to enter information will have a form of some sort.
          Forms can have
          <code>placeholder</code> text, as such:
        </p>
        <input type="text" placeholder="This is placeholder text..." />
        <p>
          However, screen readers cannot access placeholder text, so it's
          important to ensure that all forms have a label associated with it. To
          achieve this, match the label's <code>for</code> attribute to the
          form's <code>id</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>Example</h3>

        <label for="email">Email</label>
        <input
          id="email"
          type="email"
          placeholder="Please enter your email..."
        />

        <p>The HTML for the form above looks like this:</p>

        <pre class="form-html"><code>&lt;label for="email">Email&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input id="email" type="email"
placeholder="Please enter your email..."/&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          If for some reason your site can't have visible labels, make sure to
          add an <code>aria-label</code> attribute to the form. This will make
          sure that your form is still accessible to screen readers.
